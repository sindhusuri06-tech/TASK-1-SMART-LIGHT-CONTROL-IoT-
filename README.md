# Task 1: Smart Light Control (IoT)

## Objective
To design a smart light control system using a microcontroller
and mobile-based commands.

## Description
This project demonstrates controlling an LED light using
Arduino. Commands are sent from a mobile app via
Bluetooth or WiFi to turn the light ON or OFF.

## Components Used
- Arduino UNO
- LED
- Resistor
- Mobile Application (concept)

## Working
- Send '1' from mobile → LED ON
- Send '0' from mobile → LED OFF

## Conclusion
This project represents a basic IoT-based smart lighting system
used in home automation.
